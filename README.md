# Olympiapark Munich Event to icalendar parser.

This program fetches the events taking place in Olympiapark in Munich
and converts them to an ical file which can be read by e.g. Thunderbird.

The output will be written to 'cal_olypark.ics' in the current directory.

One may wants to adjust the 'url' variable below, currently it lists the
events of 2017.

# Usage
    * flag 'olyparser.py' executable (e.g. ```chmod +x olyparser.py```)
    * run olyparser.py: ./olyparser.py
    * the output will be written to 'cal_olypark.ics'
